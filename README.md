The contributions of our work are:

* We describe S-SYNTH, an open-source, flexible framework for creation of highly-detailed 3D skin models and digitally rendered synthetic images of iverse human skin tones, with full control of underlying parameters and the image formation process.
  
* We systematically evaluate S-SYNTH synthetic images for training and testing applications. Specifically, we show S-SYNTH synthetic images improve segmentation performance when only a limited set of real images is available for training. We also show comparative trends between S-SYNTH synthetic images and real-patient examples (according to skin color and lesion size) are similar.

## Framework

We present S-SYNTH, the first knowledge-based, adaptable open-source skin simulation framework to rapidly generate synthetic skin models and images using digital rendering of an anatomically inspired multi-layer, multi-component skin and growing lesion model. The skin model allows for controlled variation in skin appearance, such as skin color, presence of hair, lesion size, skin and lesion colors, and blood fraction among other parameters. We use this framework to study the effect of possible variations on the development and evaluation of AI models for skin lesion segmentation, and show that results obtained using synthetic data follow similar comparative trends as real dermatologic images, while mitigating biases and limitations from existing datasets including small dataset size, mislabeled examples, and lack of diversity.

S-SYNTH can be used to generate synthetic skin images with annotations (including segmentation masks) with variations:

**Usage:** S-SYNTH relies on [Houdini](https://www.sidefx.com/) for creating of skin layers and [Mitsuba](https://mitsuba-renderer.org/) for rendering.

## Code
The code will be available soon.
  

## Data
Associated data for this repository, including pre-generated synthetic skin examples and their masks, can be found in a Huggingface dataset repo ([S-SYNTH data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/didsr/ssynth_data)).
